Olympic Rings
=============

In this project you will write a program that displays a design similar to the Olympic Rings. Your program will have about 13 lines of code and use the following functions (some more than once):

*	`ellipse()`  
*	`size()`  
*	`noFill()`  
*	`stroke()`  
*	`strokeWeight()`


Extensions
-----------------------
If you have extra time, you might see if you can figure out how to use the `arc` function to make interlocking rings
