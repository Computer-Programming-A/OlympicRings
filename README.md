In this project you will write a program using [code.org game lab](https://code.org/educate/gamelab) that displays a design similar to the [Olympic Rings](https://www.olympic.org/olympic-rings). You may find slides 15 - 26 of the [Computer Programm A slide presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fm_Di0qR4HpRWTf8tJtcW3u5by3OrilfXIPZ517K1js/edit?usp=sharing) helpful. Your program will use the following functions (some more than once):

*	`ellipse()`  
*	`noFill()`  
*	`stroke()`  
*	`strokeWeight()`

Common Mistakes
-----------------------
* Make sure you set the `stroke` *before* you draw the `ellipse`
* Once you call `noFill()`, from then on, all ellipses will be unfilled. Don't call it more than once
* Same with `strokeWeight()`. Once you set the thickness of the outline it will remain unchanged

Extensions
-----------------------
If you have extra time, you might see if you can figure out how to use the `arc` function instead of `ellipse` to make interlocking rings
